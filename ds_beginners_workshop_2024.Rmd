# DataSHIELD Beginners Workshop, Tuesday 24th October 2024

The plan for this workshop is as follows:

## Part 1: learning
- Brief recap on principles of DataSHIELD
- Loading packages
- How to log in and assign data
- Describing data (aggregate-type functions)
- Manipulating data (assign-type functions)
- Making graphs
- Performing regression analysis
- Saving and loading workspaces

## Part 2: practical

To demonstrate this, we will use the three simulated datasets based on a model derived 
from the participants of the 1958 Birth Cohort, as part of the obesity methodological development project. 

# Part 1: learning
## Brief recap on principles of DataSHIELD

## Information on RMarkdown files
  
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you 
execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the green arrow on the top right of the chunk or by 
placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

## Loading packages
To run DataSHIELD you need a set of packages installed on the server you will connect to, and in 
your local R environment. The installation of the serverside packages is managed by the data owner.

We need to install one local package. When prompted type '3'
```{r}
library(remotes)
# install.packages("DSI")
# install_github("datashield/dsBaseClient")
# install_github("timcadman/ds-helper")
install_github("molgenis/dsTidyverseClient")
```

And load all the required libraries:
```{r}
library(DSI)
library(dsBaseClient)
library(dsHelper)
library(DSMolgenisArmadillo)
library(dsTidyverseClient)
```

## How to log in and assign data
For practical reasons, the data for this workshop is hosted on one server. However, for illustrative
purposes we will imagine that each study is hosted by a different institution: the first by UMCG 
Groningen, the second by Liverpool University and the third by ISGlobal, Barcelona. 

To login within DataSHIELD, first you need to create an R object which holds all of the login 
information. The first step is to request a token. Run the block of code below and a page will
open in your browser. Click `submit` and then in the next page enter your login details in the
`username` and `password` boxes.

```{r}
url <- "https://armadillo-demo.molgenis.net/"
token <- armadillo.get_token(url)
```

Now we create an object containing the token and other required login details:
```{r}
builder <- DSI::newDSLoginBuilder()
builder$append(server = "Groningen", url = url, token = token, table = "ds-workshop-24/data/CNSIM1", driver = "ArmadilloDriver", profile = "workshop")
builder$append(server = "Liverpool", url = url, token = token, table = "ds-workshop-24/data/CNSIM2", driver = "ArmadilloDriver", profile = "workshop")
builder$append(server = "Barcelona", url = url, token = token, table = "ds-workshop-24/data/CNSIM3", driver = "ArmadilloDriver", profile = "workshop")
logindata <- builder$build()
```

Now we can connect, referring to the login information we have just defined:
```{r}
conns <- DSI::datashield.login(logins = logindata, assign = TRUE, symbol = "data")
```
The 'assign' argument can be set to either 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'. If set to 'TRUE', 
all the available variables within that table will be added to a serverside 
data frame. If you only need a small subset of available 
variables it can be preferable to set this to 'FALSE' and later use the function 
`datashield.assign` to separately add only the variables you need. 

We can see the serverside object that has been created by running:
```{r}
ds.ls()
```

Here you see one dataframe in each study called 'data' (this name was set using the 
'symbol' argument in datashield.login above).

We can also view the local workspace by using the normal R command `ls()`:
```{r}
ls()
```
Do you understand the difference between these two commands?

## Describing data ('aggregate-type functions')
Aggregate-type functions are the functions you will use to return summaries of your data. 
There are many data exploration functions already implemented into DataSHIELD. You can view what
is available in the wiki:
https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/pages/1184825438/List+of+all+DataSHIELD+functions+v6.1
A number of additional functions have also been implemented in the packages `dsTidyverseClient` and
`dsHelper`.

### Describing data using base DataSHIELD
Two important functions allow you to view the dimensions of the data:
```{r}
ds.dim(x = "data")
```
The first number gives the number of rows in the data, the second gives the number of columns. 
So for example, Groningen has 2163 rows and 11 columns.

We can also view the column names of a data frame:
```{r}
ds.colnames(x = "data")
```
All datasets have the same columns, because in this example we have harmonised data.

What do you think will happen if you try to run this command:
```{r}
ds.head("data")
```

We can also return summary information about variables within that data frame. Let's focus on 
HDL Cholesterol:

```{r}
ds.class(x='data$LAB_HDL')
```
We see that it is a numeric variable ...

```{r}
ds.length(x='data$LAB_HDL')
```
The length e.g. in Groningen is 2163 (number of rows)

```{r}
ds.mean(x='data$LAB_HDL')
```
And the mean value for Groningen is 1.569

A important fact to note in DataSHIELD is that these results can be assigned to an object
within a local R session. This is because such results do not disclose individual level data. By
saving these results to local R objects we can reuse them (e.g. to make tables and graphs for 
publications)

```{r}
var_summary <- ds.var(x = "data$LAB_HDL", type = "split")
var_summary
```
If you look in your `environment` tab on the top right, you'll see that you've created a new
object in your local workspace which has saved the variance of this variable. 


### Describing data using dsHelper 
Whilst core DataSHIELD functions return all the information you need, sometimes many lines of 
code can be required, and the output can be quite messy. Also with core DataSHIELD functions
you can only summarise one variable at a time. To help with this, the `dsHelper` package 
allows you to do some common operations in a more streamlined way, and return neater results.

For example, using `dsHelper` you can summarise not one but many different variables within a 
dataframe:
```{r}
neat_stats <- dh.getStats(
	df = "data",
  vars = c("LAB_TSC", "LAB_TRIG", "LAB_HDL", "LAB_GLUC_ADJUSTED", 
           "PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS", "DIS_CVA", "MEDI_LPD", "DIS_DIAB", "DIS_AMI", 
           "GENDER", "PM_BMI_CATEGORICAL"))
           
neat_stats
```

Here you see this has returned a list of two tibbles separated into continuous 
and categorical information. For the categorical variables info is returned on 
ns, percentages and missingness within each category, whilst for continuous 
variables info is returned on mean, standard deviation, quantiles and also 
missingness.

## Manipulating data ('assign-type' functions)
Assign-type functions are ones where a calculation is done on the data stored at 
the server, and the results of that calculation are stored in a serverside 
variable. Results are NOT transmitted back to the user as they contain individual-level data or
could be used to infer individual-level data.

## Manipulating data using base DataSHIELD
We can do common transformations of variables using base datashield functions. For example we can
perform a logorithmic conversion of a continuous variable:
```{r}
ds.log(x='data$LAB_HDL', newobj='LAB_HDL_log')
```

We can then compare the mean of the original variable and new variable to check that check that this 
conversion has worked correctly:
```{r}
ds.mean(x="LAB_HDL_log")
ds.mean(x="data$LAB_HDL")
```

By standard, all assign-type function create a new variable separate to the original dataframe. If
you want the new variable to be a column in the original dataframe, you need to join it back in:
```{r}
ds.dataFrame(c("data", "LAB_HDL_log", "LAB_HDL_log"), newobj = "data")
ds.colnames("data")
```

## Subsetting data
In base DataSHIELD there is one function that allows sub-setting of data (`ds.dataFrameSubset`). 
The main function is to remove rows based on a condition. For example, you might want to create
separate data frames for males and females:

```{r}
ds.dataFrameSubset(
  df.name = "data", 
  V1.name = "data$GENDER", 
  V2.name = "0", 
  Boolean.operator = "==", 
  newobj = "CNSIM_males")

ds.dataFrameSubset(
  df.name = "data", 
  V1.name = "data$GENDER", 
  V2.name = "1", 
  Boolean.operator = "==", 
  newobj = "CNSIM_females")
```
We have now created two additional server-side objects which have split `data` by participant sex:
`CNSIM_males" and "CNSIM_females". We can check this by looking at the dimensions of the new
data frames:

```{r}
ds.dim("CNSIM_males")
ds.dim("CNSIM_females")
```

## Data manipulation using `dsTidyverseClient`
Many standard data manipulation operations are not available in base R. However, the 
`dsTidyVerseClient` package now implements many function from the R `TidyVerse` collection of 
packages to make our lives easier.

### Removing columns from a data frame
```{r}
ds.select(
  df.name = "data", 
  tidy_select = list(contains("LAB")), 
  newobj = "cols_removed"
)

ds.colnames("cols_removed")
```

### Removing rows from a data frame using complex conditions
```{r}
ds.filter(
  df.name = "data", 
  expr = list(GENDER == 1 & PM_BMI_CATEGORICAL == 3), 
  newobj = "filtered"
)

ds.dim("filtered")
```

### Renaming variables
```{r}
ds.rename(
  df.name = "data", 
  tidy_select = list(sex = GENDER, bmi = PM_BMI_CATEGORICAL), 
  newobj = "cols_renamed"
)

ds.colnames("cols_renamed")
```

## Making graphs
Visualising the data we are studying is extremely important to get a sense of it. 
While it may seem disclosive at first glance, only such graphs that are 
definitively non-disclosive have been implemented within the DataSHIELD project.

### Histograms
Firstly, histograms give a good sense of how one variable is distributed. But 
no individual points are disclosed because values are "binned" into groups of a 
similar magnitude, disguising what each one actually is. We protect privacy by 
removing bins with low counts (below specific threshold). If you have a 
symmetric distribution, you may find some things aren't observed at the extreme ends.

Let's create a histogram of the variable we've been investigating for much of 
this study: HDL Cholesterol ("LAB_HDL").

```{r}
ds.histogram(x='data$LAB_HDL')
```

### Scatterplots of two numerical variables
DataSHIELD generates anonymised scatter plots using two methods: 

- By adding a small amount of randomised noise to the scatter plot. 
- By taking the average of the k nearest neighbours. 

(for more details on how 
anonymisation methods are used for the generation of privacy-preserving 
visualisations you can have a look on the paper 
https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00257-4)

```{r}
ds.scatterPlot(x = "data$LAB_HDL", y = "data$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS")
```

Other DataSHIELD graphical functions allow the creation of box plots, 
heatmap plots and contour plots. Investigate them using their help functions:
```{r}
?ds.heatmapPlot
?ds.contourPlot
?ds.boxPlot
```

####################################################################################################

## Performing regression analysis
An example research question is to understand whether BMI is associated with HDL cholestrol. To do
this we can use a linear regression model. Within DataSHIELD there are two ways to do this: 
(i) one-stage 'pooled' analysis or (ii) two-stage meta-analysis approach.

### One-stage pooled analysis
This approach is mathematically equivalent to placing the individual-level data from all sources in 
one data frame and conducting a regression analysis. The link-function is defined by the 'family'
argument, so for linear regression use 'gaussian', for logistic regression 'binomial' and so on.
 
```{r}
one_stage_out <- ds.glm(formula = "data$LAB_HDL ~ data$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS", family = "gaussian")
```

We can then look at the coefficients from the model:
```{r}
one_stage_out$coefficients
```

This shows that higher levels of HCL are associated with lower levels of BMI.

### Two-stage meta-analysis
With the two-stage approach, a regression model is fit separately within each cohort, and estimates
are combined using meta-analysis and returned to the researcher.

```{r}
two_stage_out <- ds.glmSLMA(
  formula = "data$LAB_HDL ~ data$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS", 
  family = "gaussian", 
  newobj = "workshop.obj")
```

Again, we can view the coefficients from the model for each study and combined. This returns
the coefficients for each study:
```{r}
two_stage_out$betamatrix.valid
```

And this returns the meta-analysed coefficient:
```{r}
two_stage_out$SLMA.pooled.ests.matrix
```

For the SLMA approach we can also assign the predicted values at each study:
```{r}
ds.glmPredict(glmname = "workshop.obj", newobj = "workshop.prediction.obj")
```

```{r}
ds.cbind(c('data$LAB_HDL', 'data$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS'), newobj='vars')
ds.completeCases('vars', newobj='vars.complete')
```

We can then use these predicted values to calculate residuals and plot these for diagnostic purposes:
```{r}
glmslma <- ds.glmSLMA(
  formula = "vars.complete$LAB_HDL ~ vars.complete$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS", 
  family = "gaussian", 
  newobj = "workshop.obj")

ds.make(
  toAssign = paste0(
    "(", glmslma$SLMA.pooled.ests.matrix[1,1],")+(",
    glmslma$SLMA.pooled.ests.matrix[2,1], "*vars.complete$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS)"), 
  newobj = "predicted.values")

ds.make(
  toAssign = "vars.complete$LAB_HDL - predicted.values", 
  newobj = "residuals")

# and you can use those to run regression plot diagnostics  
ds.scatterPlot('predicted.values', "residuals")
```

### Plotting our findings
```{r}
ds.forestplot(
  mod = two_stage_out, 
  variable = "data$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS"
)
```

If you want to have greater control over the format of your forest plots, you can extract the 
coefficients from `two_stage_out` and create your own plots however you would normally using 
base R.

## Saving and loading workspaces

You can save your serverside workspace. This saves all the objects you created using assign-type
functions, ie those showed with `ds.ls()`
```{r}
datashield.workspace_save(conns = conns, ws = "workspace2024")
```

You can save your client-side workspace. This contains all the summary statistics you saved locally,
and which you can view using `ls()`
```{r}
save.image()
```

Finally, you can log out of your DataSHIELD session:
```{r}
# datashield.logout(conns)
```

To restore your workspace, the next time you want to continue with your analysis
```{r}
# conns <- datashield.login(logins = logindata, restore = , symbol = "workspace2024")
# ds.ls()
```

## Practical
To put this into practice, we would like you to write your own code to answer a simple research
question:

- Is higher blood glucose levels associated with higher BMI?

You will use the same data set (`data`)
The variable describing blood glucose levels is `LAB_GLUC_ADJUSTED`
The variable describing BMI is the same as previously `PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS`

To do so, please complete the following steps:

1. Calculate the mean values for BMI and blood glucose levels
2. Make a scatter plot for the same two variables
3. Run a two-stage meta-analysis to see if these variables are associated 
(hint: formula = "data$PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS ~ data$LAB_GLUC_ADJUSTED")
4. What are the coefficients for `LAB_GLUC_ADJUSTED` for each cohort?
5. Plot the findings from your meta-analysis in a forest plot. 

Bonus tasks if finished:
6. Make a scatter plot showing the residuals of your model
7. Make a forest plot using a different theme
